### Basic Server Information
Here's where the basic info is and stuff.

## Claims

You must claim your own land in order to protect it from looting and griefing. 
It is against the rules to steal from people, but this ensures the safety of your base. Every hour you accrue 100 passive claim blocks, you can get more of them by voting, doing /buyclaimblocks ($1/block), or by buying a claimblock booster. 

You can get a tutorial of how to claim by going to http://bit.ly/mcgpuser

**Every 6 months your claim will be purged unless you have 10,000 claim blocks**

If you have been offline for more than 6 months, players may request to remove your claim if it's in the way.


## Voting

Each vote gives the following: 1 Vote Key, $100, 200 Claim Blocks, a Diamond, and 8 Cooked Beef.

Each vote contributes to the Vote Party and upon reaching 20 votes, everyone online will get 2 Vote Keys, 250 Claim Blocks, and 1 Hour of /fly
