### Basic Server Information
Here's where the basic info is and stuff.

## Claims

You must claim your own land in order to protect it from looting and griefing. 
It is against the rules to steal from people, but this ensures the safety of your base. Every hour you accrue 100 passive claim blocks, you can get more of them by voting, doing /buyclaimblocks ($1/block), or by buying a claimblock booster. 

You can get a tutorial of how to claim by going to http://bit.ly/mcgpuser

**Every 6 months your claim will be purged unless you have 10,000 claim blocks**

If you have been offline for more than 6 months, players may request to remove your claim if it's in the way.


## Voting

Each vote gives the following: 1 Vote Key, $100, 200 Claim Blocks, a Diamond, and 8 Cooked Beef with the chance to get rare votes for more of those!

Each vote contributes to the Vote Party and upon reaching 20 votes, everyone online will get 2 Vote Keys, 250 Claim Blocks, and 1 Hour of /fly


## Making Money

You can make money by voting, selling items to the server, or selling items to other players!

If you type /sellgui and put the items you wish to sell then click the emerald it will give you $$ directly from the server.

If you type /warp market and roam around, you can find shops that say BUYING, click on the sign, and type in chat how many you wish to sell.

If you type /vote and vote there, you'll get $100 guaranteed per vote with the chance for lucky votes for even more.


## Quests

Doing /quests will get you to the quests GUI. In here you will be able to accept Daily, Weekly, and Monthly quests.

Doing /questshop will take you to the quest shop. Inside you will be able to redeem your quest points for various keys, mcMMO credits, fly booster, and elytra.
